I worked in the Lin Labratory at Vanderbilt University, conducting experiments for two research projects regarding nanofiltration membranes. I studied the effect extreme pH conditions have on commercial membrane performance. In addition, I worked on fabricating layer-by-layer polyelectrolyte nanofiltration membranes to aid in the separation of hydroxide from carbonate and phosphate.
